# Bank-Loan-Dashboard
Bank Loan Analysis using SQL & Power BI

📘 Project Description

This project presents a comprehensive Bank Loan Analysis aimed at exploring and visualizing key metrics within a financial institution’s loan portfolio. The goal is to provide actionable insights into loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, DTI ratios, and the classification of good vs. bad loans.
The workflow covers the complete data analytics lifecycle — from importing and cleaning raw data, writing SQL queries to extract insights, to developing interactive Power BI dashboards with advanced filters, drill-down capabilities, and KPI tracking.
This project serves as a decision-support tool for financial analysts, banks, and stakeholders to make data-driven lending decisions.
